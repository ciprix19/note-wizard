/*
This code will modify the values in the audio buffer by multiplying them with the corresponding Hamming window coefficients.
The Hamming window function is defined by the equation: w(n) = 0.54 - 0.46 * cos(2Ï€n / (N - 1)),
where n is the index of the sample and N is the length of the buffer.

By applying the Hamming window, you can reduce spectral leakage, which can improve the accuracy of frequency
analysis
